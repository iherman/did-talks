# Talks on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

This is a list of my talks on Decentralized Identities (DIDs), a technical specification developed in the [W3C DID Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/), that I am part of as part of my job at the [Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org).

> The slides are currently in development!!!

Specific talks:

* [Generic Talk](./generic/): as its name suggests, not aimed at a specific presentation; it is a full slide set that can be instantiated for a specific presentation. This slide set frequently changes and evolves.
