# Talks on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

This is a list of my talks on Decentralized Identities (DIDs), a technical specification developed in the [W3C DID Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/). I am the W3C staff contact if this group as part of my job at the [Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org).

> The slides are currently in development!!!

Specific talks:

* [Generic Talk](./generic/): as its name suggests, not aimed at a specific presentation; it is a full slide set that can be instantiated for a specific presentation. This slide set frequently changes and evolves.
* 2020
    * [Introduction to DID](./2020-evangelists): talk held on the 27th of April, 2020, to the W3C Evangelists as a DID Introduction
