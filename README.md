# Talks on Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

My own talks about the [Decentralized Identities (DIDs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) technologies, as defined by the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/).

The talks are in HTML, using the [reveal.js toolkit](https://revealjs.com/). The talks themselves are listed in [./talks](https://iherman.github.io/talks/).
